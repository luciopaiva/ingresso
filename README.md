Check live movie session seat maps right from you terminal window with this cool app.

## How to install

Since this is a Node.js application, you need it installed before continuing. Refer to https://nodejs.org for details. This has been tested with Node.js v9 and v10, but it should work just fine with v7.6 or higher (which brought async/await support), although I'm not totally sure.

    git clone git@github.com:luciopaiva/ingresso.git
    cd ingresso
    npm install

## How to use it

To use it, just run:

    ./ingresso.sh

It will interactively guide you through the steps involved in finding your movie session. Use the arrow keys to choose among options and press return key to select it.

After a session is selected, the seat map will be shown:
